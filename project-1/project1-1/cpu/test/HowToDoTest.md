# CPU Scheduler

This directory contains files for evaluating your CPU Scheduler. There are 3 test cases in total, each of which introduces a different workload.

## Understanding CPU Scheduler Testing  
While designing your CPU scheduler, there are a few things to consider:  
1. What are the kinds of workloads/situations that the scheduler needs to handle?  
2. What is the average case and what are the edge cases?
3. What statistics would help in making a scheduling decision?  

### Test Cases
We provide three test cases as a starting point. Each test is described below, along with the rationale behind the tests. The point we're trying to illustrate is the expected behavior, so we'll not focus on the actual percentages for usage. The setup for each test is the same — there are 8 VMs running on 4 CPU cores.   

#### **Test Case 1**  
**Scenario**: There are 8 VMs with 1 CPU each, running similar workloads. The vCPUs are pinned such that there are 2 vCPUs pinned to each pCPU.   

**Expected scheduler behavior**: Since pinning is already balanced, your scheduler should not be doing any additional work.  

**Sample output**:
```
Iteration 1:
0 - usage: 100.0 | mapping ['aos_vm3', 'aos_vm2']
1 - usage: 99.0 | mapping ['aos_vm4', 'aos_vm5']
2 - usage: 99.0 | mapping ['aos_vm8', 'aos_vm7']
3 - usage: 100.0 | mapping ['aos_vm1', 'aos_vm6']
Iteration 2:
0 - usage: 100.0 | mapping ['aos_vm3', 'aos_vm2']
1 - usage: 99.0 | mapping ['aos_vm4', 'aos_vm5']
2 - usage: 99.0 | mapping ['aos_vm8', 'aos_vm7']
3 - usage: 99.0 | mapping ['aos_vm1', 'aos_vm6']
Iteration 3:
0 - usage: 100.0 | mapping ['aos_vm3', 'aos_vm2']
1 - usage: 100.0 | mapping ['aos_vm4', 'aos_vm5']
2 - usage: 100.0 | mapping ['aos_vm8', 'aos_vm7']
3 - usage: 100.0 | mapping ['aos_vm1', 'aos_vm6']
```
Note that the pinnings do not change across iterations. In summary, the scheduler does not take any action.  

**What are we testing here?**  
This is the base case. The scheduler should be able to determine that the CPU utilization is balanced.  

#### **Test Case 2**  
**Scenario**: There are 8 VMs with 1 CPU each, running similar workloads. All the vCPUs are pinned to pCPU0.   

**Expected scheduler behavior**: Pins should be changed such that there are 2 vCPUs pinned to each available pCPU.  

**Sample output**:
```
Iteration 1:
0 - usage: 100.0 | mapping ['aos_vm3', 'aos_vm2', 'aos_vm1', 'aos_vm4', 'aos_vm6', 'aos_vm5', 'aos_vm7', 'aos_vm8']
1 - usage: 0.0 | mapping []
2 - usage: 0.0 | mapping []
3 - usage: 0.0 | mapping []
Iteration 2:
0 - usage: 150.0 | mapping ['aos_vm3', 'aos_vm2', 'aos_vm7']
1 - usage: 99.0 | mapping ['aos_vm4', 'aos_vm5']
2 - usage: 50.0 | mapping ['aos_vm8']
3 - usage: 99.0 | mapping ['aos_vm1', 'aos_vm6']
Iteration 3:
0 - usage: 100.0 | mapping ['aos_vm3', 'aos_vm2']
1 - usage: 100.0 | mapping ['aos_vm4', 'aos_vm5']
2 - usage: 100.0 | mapping ['aos_vm8', 'aos_vm7']
3 - usage: 100.0 | mapping ['aos_vm1', 'aos_vm6']
Iteration 4:
0 - usage: 100.0 | mapping ['aos_vm3', 'aos_vm2']
1 - usage: 100.0 | mapping ['aos_vm4', 'aos_vm5']
2 - usage: 100.0 | mapping ['aos_vm8', 'aos_vm7']
3 - usage: 100.0 | mapping ['aos_vm1', 'aos_vm6']
```
The scheduler may take a few iterations to arrive at a stable pinning. Once the workloads on each pCPU is balanced, the scheduler should not make unnecessary changes to the pins.  
 
**What are we testing here?**  
This is the second part of the base case. The scheduler should be able to just change pinnings to balance the utilization.    


#### **Test Case 3**  
**Scenario**: There are 8 VMs with 1 CPU each but 4 VMs run a heavy workload and 4 VMs run a light load. The vCPUs are equally likely to run on any pCPU. In other words, the vCPUs are randomly pinned initially.   

**Expected scheduler behaviour**: The scheduler should use some statistic to decide the optimal pinning which will balance the workload across the pCPUs.

**Sample output**:
Let's assume that VMs 1,2,3 and 4 run heavy loads, and VMs 5,6,7 and 8 run light loads. We will use 50 to represent a light load and 100 to represent a heavy load. 
```
Iteration 1:
0 - usage: 150.0 | mapping ['aos_vm3', 'aos_vm2', 'aos_vm1']
1 - usage: 100.0 | mapping ['aos_vm5']
2 - usage: 100.0 | mapping ['aos_vm7']
3 - usage: 250.0 | mapping ['aos_vm6', 'aos_vm4', 'aos_vm8']
Iteration 2:
0 - usage: 150.0 | mapping ['aos_vm3', 'aos_vm2', 'aos_vm1']
1 - usage: 200.0 | mapping ['aos_vm8', 'aos_vm5']
2 - usage: 100.0 | mapping ['aos_vm7']
3 - usage: 150.0 | mapping ['aos_vm6', 'aos_vm4']
Iteration 3:
0 - usage: 150.0 | mapping ['aos_vm3', 'aos_vm8']
1 - usage: 150.0 | mapping ['aos_vm4', 'aos_vm5']
2 - usage: 150.0 | mapping ['aos_vm7', 'aos_vm2']
3 - usage: 150.0 | mapping ['aos_vm6', 'aos_vm4']
Iteration 4:
0 - usage: 100.0 | mapping ['aos_vm3', 'aos_vm8']
1 - usage: 100.0 | mapping ['aos_vm4', 'aos_vm5']
2 - usage: 100.0 | mapping ['aos_vm7', 'aos_vm2']
3 - usage: 100.0 | mapping ['aos_vm6', 'aos_vm4']
```
The VMs are randomly pinned initially. The scheduler then pins one VM with heavy load and one VM with load load to each pCPU.  
 
**What are we testing here?**  
This is a rudimentary test for the scheduler which builds on the two previous tests. The scheduler needs to balance the utilization and change the pinnings to do so.



## Prerequisites for Testing
- Before starting these tests, ensure that you have created 8 virtual machines.

- The names of these VMs **MUST** start with *aos_* (e.g., aos_vm1 for the first VM, aos_vm2 for the second VM, etc.).

- Note that if you started with the Memory Coordinator portion of this assignment you should already have 4 VMs in place and as such will need to create 4 additional VMs. Otherwise if you are starting from this portion of the assignment you will be creating 8 VMs.

- If you need to create VMs, you can do so with the command: `uvt-kvm create aos_vm1 release=bionic --memory 512` (where 'aos_vm1' is the name of the VM you wish to create).

- Ensure the VMs are shutdown before starting. You can do this with the script *~/project1/shutdownallvm.py*

Compile the test programs for the CPU Scheduler evaluations with the following commands:

```bash
$ cd ~/project1/cpu/test/
$ ./makeall.sh
```

## Running the Tests

Follow the procedure below for each test case (using Test Case 1 as an example):

1. **Start all VMs**  
   Use the script to start all virtual machines:  
   `~/project1/startallvm.py`

2. **Copy test binaries to each VM**  
   Run the following script to copy the required binaries:  
   `~/project1/cpu/test/assignall.sh`

3. **Set up logging**  
   Open a new terminal (or a tmux/screen session) and capture terminal output using the `script` command:  
   `script vcpu_scheduler1.log`

4. **Start the monitoring tool**  
   In the same terminal, run the monitoring tool:  
   `~/project1/cpu/test/monitor.py -t runtest1.py`  
   - The output will be logged in `vcpu_scheduler1.log` for submission.  
   - Use `python3 monitor.py --help` to view available flags.

5. **Run your CPU Scheduler**  
   Open a new terminal and execute the `vcpu_scheduler` binary.

6. **Verify correct behavior**  
   Use the monitoring tool output to ensure your CPU Scheduler behaves as described in the readme:  
   `~/project1/README.md`

7. **Stop logging**  
   After the test completes, type `exit` to stop the `script` command.  
   - The log will be saved as `vcpu_scheduler1.log`.

8. **Move the log file**  
   Copy the log file to the directory:  
   `~/project1/cpu/src/`

9. **Plot the test results**  
   Generate a graph of the test run using the plotting script:  
   `python plot_graph_cpu.py -i <path to logfile> -o <path to save graph>`  
   - This graph is for self-review only and does not need to be submitted.  
   - A sample graph is available [here](../../res/sample-sol-1.pdf).

10. **Shut down the VMs**  
    Use the shutdown script:  
    `~/project1/shutdownallvm.py`

11. **Repeat for remaining test cases**  
    Repeat these steps for all test cases, updating the test case number as needed.


## Understanding Monitor Output

The *monitor.py* tool will output CPU utilization and mapping statistics in the following format:

```
Iteration Number 1:
0 - usage: 24.0 | mapping ['aos_vm3']
1 - usage: 23.0 | mapping ['aos_vm4']
2 - usage: 23.0 | mapping ['aos_vm8']
3 - usage: 23.0 | mapping ['aos_vm1']
4 - usage: 23.0 | mapping ['aos_vm7']
5 - usage: 24.0 | mapping ['aos_vm6']
6 - usage: 23.0 | mapping ['aos_vm5']
7 - usage: 24.0 | mapping ['aos_vm2']
```

The first line mentions the iteration number. Your vcpu_scheduler should be able to balance all the pCPUs in *25 iterations*. While running *~/project1/cpu/test/monitor.py -t runtest1.py*, the test case *runtest1.py* starts after 5 iterations. That is, first 5 iterations just show you the monitor output without running the test case. Then, the script executes the test (in this case *runtest1.py*). 

Where each line is of the form:

`<pCPU #> - usage: <pCPU % utilization> | mapping <VMs mapped to this pCPU>`

- The first field indicates the pCPU number.
- The second field indicates the % utilization of the given pCPU.
- The third field indicates a given pCPU's mapping to different virtual machines (vCPUs).
